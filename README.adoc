> Archived. You'll find all EE's in https://github.com/jeichler/ee - including an updated version of this one. It's pushed to https://quay.io/repository/jaeichle/ee-redhat-cop-collections

=== Why?

I am lazy and every now and then use the collections from the https://github.com/redhat-cop[Red Hat CoP] for my homelab automation.
Since I do like to use the VSCode Plugin for Ansible, I wanted to have an EE based on the creator-ee with all the collections installed.

However: be aware this is not a good practice for EEs. It's really just me being lazy.

=== Where?

The image is pushed to https://quay.io/repository/jaeichle/redhat-cop-collections-ee - the pipeline is set up to push the latest tag and the commit hash as a tag.

=== How?

I use `ansible-builder`. The https://docs.renovatebot.com/[renovate-bot] is used to update the dependencies instead of having to track them by myself.
